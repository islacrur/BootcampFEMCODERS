# Calculator - Individual Project 3 - FemCoders Norte

    Objective: develop a real calculator coding with HTML5, CSS3 and JS and make it functional. 
    
    This is a calculator that performs the most basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. You can eliminate numbers one by one or completely. 
    
    The current model has no internal memory, although this enhancement and more advanced functions are planned to be added in the near future.

## üì° Deployment

Vercel was used to perform the deployment. You can consult and use this calculator in this link:

## ‚úíÔ∏è Userflow and workflow

In order to implement projects such as this one, where there is a logical functioning, it is necessary to know the happy paths that the user will take in order to carry out, in this case, a mathematical operation.

A user flow is a chart showing the path a user will take in an application to complete a task.

Next, we have to design the workflow that our tool will perform. 

A workflow is a system for managing repetitive processes and tasks which occur in a particular order.
